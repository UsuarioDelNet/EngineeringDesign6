- Alternatively, they can be found in my [`CodeLab3 File`](https://github.com/UsuarioDelNet/EngineeringDesign6/tree/main/Labs/Lab3/CodeLab3)
- The packages I had to pip for this lab were
  - [`GeoPy`](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
  - [`Astral`](https://astral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
  - [`jdcal`](https://pypi.org/project/jdcal/)
  - [`pytz`](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)
- Please note, I replaced all the instances of "python3" with "python" in the commands for the lab, as I had Python downloaded on my system already.
